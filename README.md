**What is Cloud ?**

Cloud is basically an service provided over the internet referred as the “ Pay – as – you – go ” service . 

These services will include servers , storage , databases , networking , software , analytics and more . 

Using cloud computing, organizations can access resources on demand without needing to own and maintain physical data centers or servers.

**Key characteristics of cloud computing :**

1.	On-Demand Availability: 

	 Resources can be provided as needed without human intervention.
2.	Scalability: 
     
     It allows scaling resources up or down based on demand.

3.	Pay-as-You-Go Pricing: 
     
     Users pay only for the resources they use.

4.	Remote Accessibility: 
   
      Resources and services are accessible from anywhere over the internet.

<u>**Types of Cloud Computing:**</u>

Cloud computing is typically categorized into three main deployment models:

• <u> Public Cloud:</u>

Best for startups and organizations prioritizing cost and scalability.

•  <u> Private Cloud: </u>

Ideal for enterprises needing maximum security and customization.

•  <u> Hybrid Cloud:</u>

 Suitable for industries with fluctuating workloads and sensitive data.

•  <u> Multi-Cloud: </u>

Preferred by large enterprises seeking resilience, flexibility, and avoiding vendor lock-in.

**What is Multi-Cloud Architecture?**

Multi-cloud architecture which provides cloud services for multiple vendors .

<u>**Example :**</u>

Here , an organization can use the service of AWS for computer resources , Microsoft Azure for analytics, and Google Cloud for storage.

**Key Components of Multi-Cloud Architecture:**

1.	Cloud Management Platforms: Tools to oversee multiple cloud environments.
2.	Unified Identity Management: Ensures consistent authentication/authorization across platforms.
3.	Data Integration Layers: Synchronizes data across clouds.
Advantages of Multi-Cloud Architecture:
1.	Flexibility: Choose best-in-class services from different providers.
2.	Resilience: Fault tolerance and disaster recovery options.
3.	Cost Optimization: Use cost-effective services.
4.	Avoidance of Vendor Lock-in: Reduces reliance on a single provider.
Interoperability and Portability : 
•  Portability: Lets you move workloads to the best provider for a specific task.
•  Interoperability: Helps new services work together or replace old ones without breaking your system.
